## "Take care of each other."

"Learn the skill of helping others"
"Learn by practicing helping each other."
It will be the single most valuable thing you ever learn in your entire life, to accept help when it's offered and ask for it when you know that you can't do it. The amazing thing is when you learn to ask for help you'll discover that there are people all around you who've always wanted to help you, they just didn't think you needed it because you kept pretending that you had everything under control. And the minute you say: "I don't know what I'm doing, I'm stuck, I'm scared, I don't think I can do this." You will find that lots of people who love you will rush in and take care of you, but that'll only happen if you learn to take care of them first.
